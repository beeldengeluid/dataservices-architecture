Includes items from NISV. These have their own identifiers, and do not link back to the original NISV identifiers. Johannes Wassenaar has written a script which has allowed a number of Open Beelden items to be linked back to NISV. &#xD;&#xA;Europeana currently relies on OpenBeelden to have a link to the content of items for which metadata is harvested from NISV. There is currently no solution for what will happen when OpenBeelden fails.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
